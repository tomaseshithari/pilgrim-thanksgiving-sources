# Edward Winslow's Account from *Mourt's Relation*: The 1621 Harvest Feast

Our corn did prove well, and, God be praised, we had a good increase of Indian corn, and our barley good likewise. Our peas not worth the gathering, for we feared they were too late sown. They came up very well, and blossomed, but the sun parched them in the blossom.

> **Annotation:** Winslow opens with the same phrase "God be praised" as Bradford, indicating shared Puritan emphasis on attributing agricultural success to divine favor.

Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week. At which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed five deer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of God, we are so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty.

> **Annotation:** The phrase "by the goodness of God" mirrors Bradford's language, framing abundance as divine gift. The description of feasting and recreation with Native Americans is more detailed, perhaps reflecting Winslow's role as a diplomat and his focus on cross‑cultural relations.

We have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us; very loving and ready to pleasure us. We often go to them, and they come to us; some of us have been fifty miles by land in the country with them; the occasions and relations whereof you shall understand by our general and more full declaration of things. We have placed our dwellings and built our houses in a most wholesome and pleasant situation, and we have good store of fish, fowl, and venison, etc. And we have here competent means to live comfortably, if we are but thankful to God for His mercies.

> **Annotation:** Like Bradford, Winslow uses the term "covenant of peace," invoking Puritan covenant theology. The closing call to be "thankful to God for His mercies" reinforces the religious imperative of gratitude, a core Puritan virtue.
